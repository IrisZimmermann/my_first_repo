# My personal site #

## It is important, not to live for the work, but to enjoy it as much as possible, since it should be fun, too! ##


*I like...*

1. Good friends, which go on adventures together 
2. New ideas and things, which improve life and make it easier
3. Good books, for relaxation and personal education
